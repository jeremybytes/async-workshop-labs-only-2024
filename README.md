# Async and Parallel Programming in C# - Labs Only (2024)  

## Description  
This repository contains the labs for the "Asynchronous and Parallel Programming in C#" workshop.  

For a full description of the workshop, please refer to the original event link.  

* Visual Studio LIVE! Microsoft HQ (August 2024)

## Pre-Requisites:  

Basic understanding of C# and object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, methods, and properties). No prior experience with asynchronous programming is necessary; we'll take care of that as we go.  

## Lab Requirements:

* You must provide your own laptop computer (Windows or Mac) for this hands-on lab.

* You need to have the .NET 6 SDK or .NET 8 SDK installed as well as the code editor of your choice (Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or Visual Studio Code are both good (free) choices).

* Interactive labs, web application samples, and console samples will work with Windows, macOS, and Linux (anywhere .NET 6/8 will run).

* WPF desktop samples will only work on Windows machines. There are equivalent web and console examples for these projects.

### Links:

* .NET 8.0 SDK

* Visual Studio 2022 (Community)
[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
Note: Install the "ASP.NET and web development" workload for the labs and samples. Include ".NET desktop development" for "digit-display" sample and WPF-based samples.

## Hands-On Labs  

This folder contains hands-on labs. The labs are integrated throughout the workshop day.    

* [Lab 01 - Recommended Practices and Continuations](Lab01/)
* [Lab 02 - Adding Async to an Existing Application](Lab02/)
* [Lab 03 - Parallel Practices](Lab03/)
* [Lab BONUS - Working with AggregateException](LabBONUS-AggregateException/)
* [Lab BONUS - Unit Testing Asynchronous Methods](LabBONUS-UnitTesting/)

Each lab consists of the following:

* **Labxx-Instructions** (Markdown)  
A markdown file containing the lab instructions. This includes the scenario, a set of goals, and step-by-step instructions.  
This can be viewed on GitHub or in Visual Studio Code (just click the "Open Preview to the Side" button in the upper right corner).

* **Starter** (Folder)  
This folder contains the starting code for the lab.

* **Completed** (Folder)  
This folder contains the completed solution. If at any time, you get stuck during the lab, you can check this folder for a solution.
